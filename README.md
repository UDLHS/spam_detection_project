# 📧 Spam Detection Model

A simple machine learning project to detect spam messages using natural language processing techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a dataset of labeled SMS messages to train a model that can classify whether a message is **spam** or **not spam**. It includes preprocessing, vectorization, and training using popular ML algorithms.

## 🧠 Features

- Text preprocessing (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF
- Model training (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Predict user-input messages in real time (optional)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK / re (for text cleaning)
- Jupyter Notebook or plain `.py` script
